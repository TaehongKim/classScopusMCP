Thus, a number of computational data-driven methodologies have been introduced in this article, as alternatives, to formulate cross-correlations between the processing parameters and mechanical properties ...",pubmed
SoilEye: An Interactive Web App Prototype for Soil Sealing Monitoring,Asad A.,Lecture Notes in Computer Science,2026-01-01,10.1007/978-3-031-97617-9_14,0,105011030015,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105011030015,"The contamination of yogurt and buttermilk (doogh), two widely consumed dairy products, with microplastics (MPs) and phthalic acid esters (PAEs), and subsequently the health effects caused by the contamination of these products on humans, is a potential concern. In this study, the abundance and characteristics of MPs as well as the PAEs concentration in different types of yogurts and buttermilk available in the Iranian market were investigated. The average abundance of MPs in different types of ...",pubmed

UI/UX design requirements for young stroke survivors: recommendations from the literature,Passey D.,Npj Digital Medicine,2025-12-01,10.1038/s41746-025-01796-8,0,105010425837,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105010425837,There is currently no single resource for UI/UX guidelines and design standards that encapsulates all the requirements for young stroke survivors (<55 years) and their carers. We reviewed 25 studies to provide a summary of recommendations for designing stroke rehabilitation and self-management apps and digital platforms for young stroke survivors. The findings highlight the need for participatory codesign and research to build consensus on UI/UX guidelines and design standards.,pubmed

User experience questionnaire in sign language for native users of Slovenian sign language,Pečnik K.,Scientific Reports,2025-12-01,10.1038/s41598-025-89954-6,0,85218934061,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85218934061,"Accessibility of interactive services is vital for building an inclusive society. While accessibility standards are increasingly being adopted, there remains a gap in user experience evaluation approaches tailored to deaf participants. To address this, the User Experience Questionnaire (UEQ) was translated to Slovenian Sign Language (SSL) and its appropriateness and reliability evaluated in a research study. Two interactive TV solutions for deaf viewers were developed and evaluated using a stand...",pubmed
Three-dimensional analysis of mandibular and condylar growth using artificial intelligence tools: a comparison of twin-block and Frankel II Appliances,Shihabi R.,BMC Oral Health,2025-12-01,10.1186/s12903-025-05624-z,0,85219083916,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85219083916,"Analyzing the morphological growth changes upon mandibular advancement between Twin Block (TB) and Functional Regulator II (FR2) in Class II patients involves measuring the condylar and mandibular changes in terms of linear and volumetric measurements, as well as the distances registered after superimposition. Correspondingly, 3D digital assessment with the benefit of artificial intelligence tools was applied, and color-coded distance maps were descriptively interpreted to visualize the directio...",pubmed
A web-based platform for optimizing healthcare resource allocation and workload management using agile methodology and WISN theory,Prabhune A.G.,BMC Health Services Research,2025-12-01,10.1186/s12913-025-12473-7,1,105000408286,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105000408286,"Effective healthcare workforce management is critical for ensuring quality care delivery, particularly in resource-constrained settings. The World Health Organization's (WHO) Workload Indicators of Staffing Need (WISN) methodology provides an evidence-based framework for optimizing staffing levels. However, manual implementation of the WISN methodology is labour-intensive, error-prone, and time-consuming. To address these challenges, the Platform for Resource Allocation and Optimization for Heal...",pubmed
